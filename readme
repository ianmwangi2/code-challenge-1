** GRADE GENERATOR **

This is a simple JavaScript program that prompts the user to input students marks which are between zero and one hundred.

** HOW THE FUNCTION WORKS **
1. Open the grade-generator.js file in a code editor.
2. Run the program.
3. Enter the student's marks values.
4. The program displays the student grade after the user input the correct numeric values for marks.

** CHECKING FOR ERRORS **
The program checks for invalid inputs and displays an error message when:

** SPEED CALCULATOR **

This is a JavaScript program that takes the speed of a car in (km/h) and gives demerit points for every 5km/s above the speed limit.

** HOW IT WORKS **
1. Open the speed-detector.js file in a code editor.
2. Run the program.
3. Enter the speed of the car.
4. The program will calculate and display 'OK' if the speed is less than 70. Otherwise for every 5km/s above the speed limit(70), the program gives the driver one demerit point and if the driver gets more than 12 demerit points the function should print 'License suspended'.
